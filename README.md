# laserscan
This program controls VCSEL laser current, logs transmission through cell with Rubidium vapor and lets the user to select rubidium line to lock the laser wavelength.

Hardware used to drive the laser is very simple. It consists of 16-bit multiplying DAC used instead of current setting potentiometer, AVR processor and FT232RL USB<->RS232 translator chip.

Ui of the program is made using Qt. Plots are produced by Matplotlib library.
Ui was generated by QtCreator as separate .ui file. It simplifies process of layout arrangement and keeps it away from code.
